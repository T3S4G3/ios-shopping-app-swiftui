]
```

### Adding Product Images
1. Add images to `ShoppingApp/Assets.xcassets/`

### API Integration
Extend `CartManager` or create `NetworkManager` for:
- Product fetching from API
- User authentication
- Order processing

## Architecture

**MVVM Pattern:**
- **Models**: Data structures (`Product.swift`)
- **Views**: SwiftUI views for UI presentation
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management (`CartManager.swift`)

- **Swift Version**: 5.0
- **Bundle Identifier**: com.example.ShoppingApp
- **Supported Devices**: iPhone and iPad
- **Orientations**: Portrait, Landscape Left, Landscape Right

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Errors**
   - Ensure all files are properly added to the Xcode target
   - Check that folder structure matches exactly
   - Clean build folder: Product → Clean Build Folder

2. **Missing Files**
   - Verify all Swift files are in correct directories
   - Check project navigator in Xcode shows all files
   - Re-add missing files to project if needed

3. **Simulator Issues**
   - Try different simulator devices
   - Reset simulator: Device → Erase All Content and Settings
   - Restart Xcode if simulator doesn't respond

### Debug Tips

- Use SwiftUI previews for rapid development
- Check console output for cart operations
- Use Xcode's SwiftUI inspector for layout debugging
- Enable breakpoints for step-by-step debugging
